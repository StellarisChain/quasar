# GitHub Actions Workflow Summary

## 🚀 What Was Created

I've set up a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow system for your Quasar browser extension that automatically builds, tests, and releases your extension for both Chrome and Firefox.

## 📁 Files Created

### GitHub Workflows
- `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` - Main release workflow
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration workflow
- `.github/WORKFLOWS.md` - Detailed documentation

### Testing Script
- `scripts/test-workflow.sh` - Local workflow testing script

## 🔄 How It Works

### Automatic Releases (Recommended)
1. **Push to master branch** → Automatically triggers release
2. **Builds both Chrome and Firefox versions**
3. **Creates GitHub release with zip files**
4. **Uploads artifacts for download**

### Manual Releases
1. **Go to Actions → Build and Release**
2. **Click "Run workflow"**
3. **Choose version bump type** (patch/minor/major)
4. **Optionally mark as prerelease**

### Continuous Integration
- **Runs on all pull requests**
- **Tests on Node.js 18 and 20**
- **Validates builds work correctly**
- **No releases created**

## 📦 What Gets Built

Each workflow run creates:

```
📁 Release Assets:
├── quasar-chrome-{version}.zip     # Chrome Web Store ready
└── quasar-firefox-{version}.zip    # Firefox Add-ons ready

📁 GitHub Artifacts:
├── quasar-chrome-extension/        # Chrome build files
└── quasar-firefox-extension/       # Firefox build files
```

## 🛠 Commands Available

```bash
# Test workflow locally (recommended before pushing)
npm run test:workflow

# Manual builds (same as workflow)
npm run dist:all                    # Build both browsers
npm run dist:chrome                 # Chrome only
npm run dist:firefox                # Firefox only

# Development builds (faster)
npm run esbuild:all                 # Quick builds for testing
```

## 🎯 Typical Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Regular Development
```bash
# 1. Work on features in feature branches
git checkout -b feature/new-wallet-ui

# 2. Test locally
npm run test:workflow

# 3. Create PR to dev branch
git push origin feature/new-wallet-ui
# → CI workflow runs automatically

# 4. Merge to dev, then master
# → Release workflow runs automatically
```

### Scenario 2: Quick Patch Release
```bash
# 1. Fix bug and commit to master
git commit -m "fix: resolve wallet connection issue"
git push origin master
# → Automatic release with current version

# 2. Or use manual workflow with version bump
# Actions → Build and Release → Run workflow → patch
```

### Scenario 3: Major Release
```bash
# 1. Use manual workflow
# Actions → Build and Release → Run workflow
# Choose: release_type = "major"
# → Bumps version from 5.0.4 to 6.0.0
```

## ✅ Features

### Automated
- ✅ **Cross-browser builds** (Chrome MV3 + Firefox MV2)
- ✅ **Version management** (automatic or manual)
- ✅ **Release notes** (generated from git commits)
- ✅ **Artifact uploads** (downloadable builds)
- ✅ **Store-ready packages** (zip files)

### Smart
- ✅ **Duplicate protection** (won't create duplicate releases)
- ✅ **Build verification** (checks all required files)
- ✅ **Multi-Node testing** (Node.js 18 & 20)
- ✅ **Manifest validation** (ensures correct versions)

### Developer-Friendly
- ✅ **Local testing** (`npm run test:workflow`)
- ✅ **Clear documentation** (this file + WORKFLOWS.md)
- ✅ **Detailed logs** (step-by-step progress)
- ✅ **Summary reports** (build results overview)

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. First Time Setup
```bash
# Test that everything works locally
npm run test:workflow

# Should output: "✅ Ready for GitHub workflow! 🚀"
```

### 2. Create Your First Release
```bash
# Method A: Automatic (push to master)
git push origin master

# Method B: Manual (with version bump)
# Go to GitHub → Actions → Build and Release → Run workflow
```

### 3. Monitor the Build
- Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
- Click on the running workflow
- Watch real-time progress
- Download artifacts when complete

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Local Test Fails
```bash
npm run test:workflow
# Check what failed and fix before pushing
```

### GitHub Workflow Fails
1. Check **Actions** tab for error logs
2. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Build script errors
   - Permission issues

### Release Already Exists
- Update version in `package.json`
- Or use manual workflow with version bump

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Professional Releases**: Store-ready packages every time
2. **Zero Manual Work**: Push to master = automatic release
3. **Quality Assurance**: All builds tested before release
4. **Cross-Browser**: Both Chrome and Firefox supported
5. **Developer Experience**: Local testing + clear documentation

## 🎉 Next Steps

Your workflow is ready! Here's what to do:

1. **Test locally**: `npm run test:workflow`
2. **Push to master**: Triggers first automatic release
3. **Check GitHub Releases**: See your packaged extensions
4. **Submit to stores**: Use the generated zip files

The workflow will handle all the building, packaging, and releasing automatically from now on! 🚀
